# Allure
Game engine that is beautiful aesthetically and technically.

## Projects

### Pacman AI Showcase
Built a simple Pacman clone to visualise the Pacman Ghost AI behaviour. Was fun implementing a extendable state machine system for the AI. Optimised the map rendering by using a tilemap renderer.

Just built an audio spectrum visualiser for the fun of it.

### Minecraft Clone
As part of a computer graphic's assignment, I cloned minecraft in my game engine. Showcases the use of instance rendering to optimise the render calls, as well as some simple shader manipulation for the water and leaves behaviour. Explored post processing for bloom, and heightmaps for terrain generation too.

### Particle System
Just love the beautiful particles so I wanted to push my engine. I optimised the particles to be rendered using instance rendering.
